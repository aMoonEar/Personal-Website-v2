                            <p class="animated fadeIn mt-2">
                                I am interested in UX Development with Shopify because of their amazing e-commerce
                                solution, what Shopify is doing in the tech industry, and because of Shopify’s true
                                values. I’ll start off this answer by explaining first why I love Shopify.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>Firstly</b>, Shopify is HUGE. They’re a leader in an industry with giants, holding
                                20% of their market share. As of last year Shopify had over 1,000,000 businesses owned
                                by merchants, and has total platform sales of an estimated $100 billion to date.
                                Clearly, Shopify is doing something right because they are the best at what they do, and
                                I believe I have the skills to be on a winning team.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="figure col-lg-12 my-5 text-center">
                                <img src="img/shopifymap.png" class="figure-img img-fluid zoom">
                                <figcaption class="caption">A world map showing where Shopify is used. <a
                                        href="https://www.websitetooltester.com/en/blog/shopify-market-share/">Source</a>
                                </figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <p>
                                <b>Secondly</b>, Shopify is the king of adapting and improving. During the entire
                                pandemic,
                                Shopify added curbside pickup options for business owners, began to hire more talented
                                engineers, supported their merchants through <b>#ShopifyReunite</b>, and even extended
                                their
                                free trial to Shopify for merchants. Shopify sees every issue as an opportunity to show
                                the world why they are the best in what they do. In addition to the pandemic, Shopify
                                improves at an astonishing rate shown by the vast number of features that they
                                constantly release such as improving POS, releasing <b>Shop</b> & <b>Offset</b>, and
                                much more.
                                Working at a place like Shopify would really teach me what it means to see every
                                obstacle as an opportunity and to never stop improving.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>Thirdly</b>, Shopify is just drop dead gorgeous. I don’t ever remember seeing
                                anything
                                associated with Shopify look remotely unaesthetic. The website, the store dashboard,
                                instagram, youtube videos are all made with purposeful and meaningful design, and I
                                really appreciate that. Not to mention Shopify Polaris and Shopify UX which immensely
                                help developers create functional and aesthetic apps for Shopify.
                                <b>Good design builds trust in customers</b>, and I want to work at a company that
                                exemplifies that in every aspect. Even sections of the store navigation, like the tax
                                section (which I expected to look very complicated) were pleasant to the eye.
                            </p>

                            </figure>
                            <p>
                                Not only does everything Shopify make look good, but they designed their product for
                                every type of user. If you are a local business owner, you have the POS app and can
                                encourage customers to use shop local. If you have no experience in web development,
                                Shopify will take care of that and create a whole website for you with scratch. If you
                                are the one of the biggest brands like Kylie Cosmetics or Gymshark, Shopify can handle
                                and adapt their e-commerce solution for you. Even I, a person with little background in
                                e-commerce, was able to create my own
                                <a href="https://moonear.myshopify.com/">art store</a> in minutes and had a blast
                                (Password is: ‘moonear’, and yes I plan to dominate the painting industry with these
                                masterpieces).

                                <b>Last, and most importantly</b>, Shopify believes and invests in the future of
                                society. The Shopify sustainability fund is an amazing initiative; but I am more
                                impressed more by the tools that Shopify made to prevent global warming. Tools like Shop
                                Pay where emissions are tracked and offset, or the offset app that enables merchants to
                                make shipping emissions more carbon neutral. <b>Shopify is here to stay and is actively
                                    looking to be a part of the clean society the world desperately needs</b>.

                                What better place could I develop my love for UX development while simultaneously
                                supporting local businesses and the future of society. Shopify is clearly the best at
                                what they do, and I would love to have a chance to learn from their experiences to
                                become the best UX Developer I can be.
