                                Dear Shopifolk,
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although resumes can tell you a lot about an individual, they never tell you the journey
                                that led the person to where they are today. My name is Munir Aljawahari. I am a student
                                at the University of Ottawa, and I love using Web Development and my creativity to craft
                                elegant user experiences.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My engineering journey started in high school by simply Googling how to make mobile
                                games which sparked me to make DodgeBox, an android mobile game that is currently
                                published on the Play Store! The app may not have hit global charts, but it taught me so
                                much about research, planning, designing, and crafting; traits that are valued at a
                                place like Shopify.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This huge accomplishment pushed me to start attending hackathons, one of which I won and
                                lead me to my first internship at Health Canada. The lack of software engineers at
                                Health Canada forced me to look for ways to use software to better the team. I took it
                                upon myself to take an old PDF form that had to be FAXED (😱) into fully interactive web
                                pages that could send Health Canada data within minutes. The team loved it, which led me
                                to my next innovation of improving a shared excel sheet of project management data into
                                a Drupal website where others can collaborate simultaneously. It was a huge success!
                                They loved my positive synergy to the team and decided to offer me a role part-time
                                during school.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That intern experience led me to Qlik, where I became engulfed into the agile world and
                                perfected my collaboration and SaaS technical skills. I came into the office not knowing
                                what SaaS was, and left having experience writing unit test and component tests,
                                deploying and maintaining docker microservices, setting standards for an internal
                                library, and incorporating redis caching to reduce overall loading time. I was also able
                                to continue to spread my positive attitude to Qlik by volunteering to recruit future
                                interns at University events and hosting meetings for our development team. Overall,
                                Qlik was an environment where I felt challenged and was able to hone my skills to make
                                me the Web Developer I am today.
                            </p>

                                On the other end, my journey to love design began when I was in elementary school. I
                                remember always seeing my older brother playing with Photoshop, and learned from what he
                                did and started using Photoshop for assignments and projects in school. After gaining an
                                appreciation for what looks good, when I came into University, I was disappointed. So
                                many ads on facebook and on University walls looked plain and boring, so I mixed my
                                passion to make my campus look better with my love for software to join the Software
                                Engineering Student Association (SESA), where I became head of design for all events
                                that were advertised to thousands of students every day. SESA gained a reputation of
                                becoming one of the better looking clubs on campus.
                            </p>

                                <img src="img/sesa_fb.png" class="figure-img img-fluid zoom">

                            </figure>
                            <p>
                                I then used design to spread the love for my culture and country, Iraq. I joined the
                                Iraqi Student Association and filled in the technical role to develop their website
                                (isaottawa.com) and also redesign their brand and events. Making campus appear a little
                                more aesthetic was a big deal to me, and I was glad I was able to do that while making a
                                ton of friends and enriching my University experience. My design experience then led me
                                to create something for the good of society. I was blessed with the opportunity to
                                perform research and analysis at the University of Ottawa Medical Institute to design a
                                lifestyle app for diabetic elderly patients. My task to make it UI / UX friendly for
                                elderly folks who aren’t as familiar with technology as we are. I presented my research
                                and design to many professors at the University, and my research on usability is still
                                being used by the institute today.

                                My biggest and most recent work was to rebrand uOttaHack for the new year. My dream for
                                making my campus look beautiful was becoming reality, and I used all my past experience
                                and positive synergy to create the best looking student hackathons the city has seen.

                                The journey led me to today, applying Shopify, a company who uses design
                                to cater to every single merchant big or small (like me who was able to make my own
                                <a href="https://moonear.myshopify.com/">Shopify art store</a> in minutes, password is
                                moonear) , a
                                company that constantly innovates and adapts to truly make the best commerce solution
                                for everyone, and a company that invests and believes in the future of society.

                                Attached to my application is a link to my personal website that I built myself that
                                highlights some of my engineering and design skills. I also included a PDF that
                                highlights the design process behind designing the app “Sweet Feet”. Although I am
                                mainly hoping to work on front-end development, I am more than willing to take on any
                                other web-development roles. I am also willing to consider working in Montreal if there
                                are no positions left in Ottawa.
