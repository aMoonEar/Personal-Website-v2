                            <p class="mt-2">
                                I am the right person for this role because of my dedication to my craft and my positive
                                attitude to the workplace.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My dedication to Web Development began in high school with simple HTML/CSS through
                                codecademy. Soon enough, I was mastering Bootstrap and Javascript which allowed me to
                                today create <a href="index">munir.xyz</a>, my personal portfolio website. This
                                confidence led me to participate in hackathons such as CANDEV Government of Canada
                                hackathon (which I won WOO!) and helped me get my first internship at Health Canada.
                                <br><br>
                                Although there weren’t many software developers at Health Canada, I still learned as
                                much as I could and implemented new software into their practices. I ended up using my
                                expertise to recreate an old PDF form into an interactive webpage, and created a fully
                                custom Drupal website to aid project management, both of which were huge successes!
                                <b>Employees at Shopify always look for ways to make an impact</b>, and I wanted to make
                                as big
                                of an impact as I could within my internship, which helped me secure a part-time role
                                with them during school.

                            <p>
                                After a successful internship at Health Canada, I was able to work for the large private
                                company Qlik. Attaining that internship was a big step in making me the right person for
                                this role. During my time working at Qlik, I learned about Lodash and other libraries,
                                the importance of writing strong unit and integration tests, back-end structure
                                (middleware, models), and so much more. I came into Qlik on my first day unsure of what
                                SaaS models were, and left being able to run scrum meetings and deploy and maintain
                                microservices myself.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While having technical abilities are important, I believe what sets me apart from the
                                rest is my positive attitude and collaboration skills. At Qlik, I had a good
                                relationship with other developers because I kept a positive attitude towards learning,
                                never hesitated to ask questions, and always sought bigger opportunities to prove
                                myself.
                                <br><br>
                                This led me to become a scrum master as an intern, where I became responsible
                                for running every agile meeting building a positive atmosphere. Not to mention, I had to
                                make quick decisions based on the needs of my manager (such as expecting us to stop all
                                of our exciting feature work to barrage the endless stack of bugs). To be a scrum
                                master, not only do you have to unblock the team, but I had to understand every aspect
                                of Qlik’s product. I loved exploring potential problems for tenants, and I hope to one
                                day spread that love for finding and solving merchant issues to Shopify.

                                for positive impact in a team setting is what sets me apart from other candidates.
