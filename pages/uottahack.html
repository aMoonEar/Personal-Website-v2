          <!-- Context -->
          <h2 class="mt-3">Context</h2>
          <p class="mt-1">uOttaHack is the University of Ottawa's <b>largest ever hackathon</b>, hosted by students for
            students of all studies across Canada.
            This year, uOttaHack 3 welcomed over 400 students from February 7th-9th to collaborate on projects, learn at
            workshops, and develop their innovative ideas.
            The uOttaHack committee decided to <b>launch a rebrand</b> that will represent this special uOttaHack and
            continue to represent the face of uOttaHack for years to come.</p>


          <!-- Previous Design -->
          <h2 class="mt-3">Previous Design</h2>
          <p class="mt-1">In previous years, uOttaHack was <b>struggling to have a consistent design</b>.
            In 2018, uOttahack..... In 2019, uOttaHack adopted a trendy isometric illustration theme to appeal to
            sponsors and hackers.
            We wanted to give uOttaHack a <b>new logo and theme</b> that would remain on trend throughout the years
            <b>sustain through trends</b> but also adapt to seem different every year.</p>

                We wanted to adopt a <b>minimalistic</b> look for uOttaHack while simultaneously
                integrating with the University. I started by analysing the current <b>symbols of the university</b>,
                followed by researching logos that revolve around the letter U.

            Whenever I felt stuck on a certain design, I'd return to my notebook and continue sketching possible logos.

          <!-- Final Design -->
          <h2 class="mt-3">Final Design</h2>
          <p class="mt-1">After much debate and iterations, the following final design was created: </p>

          <div class="row justify-content-center mt-3">

            <figure class="figure col-lg-6 my-auto text-center">
              <img src="img/finalLogo.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded shadow zoom">
              <figcaption class="caption">The final logo.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <div class="col-lg-6">
              <img src="img/color.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block rounded shadow zoom">
              <p class="text-center caption mt-1"><em>Proposed logos that were scrapped.</em></p>

              <img src="img/typography.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block rounded shadow zoom mt-3">
              <p class="text-center caption mt-1"><em>Proposed logos that were scrapped.</em></p>
            </div>

          </div>

          <p class="mt-2">Purple was the base color for most designs. It was a dark color that allowed
            <b>flexibility</b> when choosing a secondary color to include.
            The addition of orange and peach to the color palette provided the much needed <b>contrast</b>. Lastly, the
            blue provided the needed <b>transition</b>
            between the purple and orange.</p>

          <p>The illustrations that were used were taken from paaaaterns. We felt that the illustration style
            complimented the color scheme that was already defined
            In addition, illustrations from humaaans, and the public humans library, and whooosh. All the types of
            illustrations used were alike, and could be combined
            to generate many social media assets ?
          </p>


          <div class="row justify-content-center mt-3">

            <figure class="figure col-lg-6 my-auto text-center">
              <img src="img/paaatterns.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded shadow zoom">
              <figcaption class="caption">The final logo.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure class="figure col-lg-6 my-auto text-center">
              <img src="img/illustrations.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded shadow zoom">
              <figcaption class="caption">The final logo.</figcaption>
            </figure>

          </div>

          <p>The next major task was to design a webpage that combined all of the elements listed above for a seamless
            experience.
            The goal was to showcase the rebrand of the hackathon while enticing students and sponsors to participate
          </p>

          <p>designing swag
            I worked with my design partner Alistair to design physical assets that would be given to hackers during the
            hackathon.
            All swag was made to conform to the style guide that we curated.
          </p>

          <p>Graphics
            in addition to swag, I also had the responsibiliy of creating many social media assets for facebook,
            instagram, linkedin. These assets included graphics
            such as promotional content, countdown posts, as well as posters that would be hung around campus (however
            did not get printed due to time constraints)

          </p>

          <p>
            takeaways
            a rebrand is not easy
            i did not expect the rebrand to take the most of the design process. it took a long time because it would
            serve as the foundation for all the work that
            would stream into the brand

            spend time into making a thorough style guide
            i underestimated the value of a style guide, especially when working on a team. luckily, i only had one
            partner, however, i see how important it is when
            working on a large team. it prevents mistakes being made, and ensures all designers are on the same page. i
            hope to keep designing in large groups
            to continue my group contribution skills.
          </p>
